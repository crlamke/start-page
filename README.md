# Start Page
This is a web start page with links and search engine options loaded from a user-config.json file. 
I'm using this project to learn basic JavaScript techniques.

# Credits
I've taken and modified code or gotten inspiration from the following sources for the components in this repo.
- https://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/Read-Parse-and-display-CSV-Text-file-using-JavaScript-jQuery-and-HTML5.aspx for the file loading and parsing component.
- https://github.com/Vogeltak/startpage for the colored grid idea
- https://startpages.github.io/ for a variety of start page ideas. Kudos to this dev for including links to the source of pages he features.
